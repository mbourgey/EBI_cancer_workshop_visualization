Actually no.

we can try to cluster based on the number of somatic mutation as it is well accepted that different cancer could lead to different level of mutation burden.

In that case S01, S04 and S05 would be clustered togther with low burden and S02, S03 and S06 would be clustered as high burden.

We would see later if this early prediction is accurate.
